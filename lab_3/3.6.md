1. The predicate function pred must be a binary function that takes two arguments and returns a boolean value (#t or #f).
1. The function should be consistent in its comparison. For any two values x and y, if (pred x y) is #t, then (pred y x) should also be #t. This ensures that the equality check is symmetric.
